            <h2>How AR & VR in Healthcare Enhances Medical Training</h2>
            <p>Medical educators are exploring innovative methods to teach and train students without relying solely on traditional resources like cadavers or real patients. They are adopting technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Extended Reality (XR) to simulate medical scenarios. This approach helps prepare not only doctors and surgeons but also nurses for actual clinical practice.</p>
            <p>In this context, Augmented Reality refers to overlaying digital information onto the real-world environment, Virtual Reality involves creating entirely immersive digital environments, and Extended Reality encompasses a combination of both AR and VR. These technologies offer realistic and interactive simulations of medical procedures and situations.</p>
            <p>By using AR, VR, and XR, medical education becomes more dynamic and engaging. Students can practice and refine their skills in a controlled and risk-free digital environment, which enhances their understanding and confidence before encountering real patients. This modern approach to medical training equips healthcare professionals with the experience and proficiency needed for their future roles, ultimately contributing to better patient care and safety.</p>

            <h2>Johns Hopkins Creates Adaptable VR for Medical Training</h2>
            <p>The Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has introduced Virtual Reality (VR) training across different nursing education levels. Kristen Brown, an assistant professor at the school and a lead at the Johns Hopkins Medicine Simulation Center, has played a key role in this. The VR training covers important medical areas such as resuscitation, managing anaphylactic reactions, postsurgical care, acute-care management, and pediatric critical care.</p>

            </div>
            <p>One of Kristen Brown's projects involves multiplayer VR scenarios for medical and nursing trainees, accommodating up to 100 learners at once. The VR setup at Johns Hopkins includes an Oculus headset and an Alienware computer from Dell Technologies. While the system offers tactile feedback through hand haptics, the training's main focus is on enhancing cognitive decision-making. Brown also integrated artificial intelligence to personalize the learning experience based on each student's progress.</p>

            <h2>Orthopedic Students Practice VR Surgical Training at Mass General</h2>
            <p>Dr. Augustus D. Mazzocca, a leader in orthopedic medicine, is using a system called PrecisionOS to enhance medical education. This system employs virtual reality (VR) headsets to create realistic training environments for orthopedic students. Unlike traditional methods, PrecisionOS allows instructors to connect to a student's VR headset, enabling real-time monitoring and guidance. This VR training enables students to practice exercises repeatedly, receiving instant feedback and improving their skills in three-dimensional surgical procedures.</p>

            <h2>AR Medical Training Provides a Graphic Look Inside the Body at UCF</h2>
            <p>The University of Central Florida College of Nursing has integrated Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) into their training programs for nurses and nurse practitioners. This implementation allows students to explore the human body's anatomy from within, aiding their understanding of pathophysiology and anatomy. This knowledge helps them make better clinical interventions.</p>
            <p>For instance, students can use AR to witness processes like strokes or heart attacks. The college uses Microsoft HoloLens and Oculus headsets, employing prepackaged simulations for complex scenarios that are hard to replicate in real-life settings. AR overlays can also show normal and problematic birth situations on a manikin's abdomen, aiding students in recognizing abnormalities and intervening effectively for better patient outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Robotic surgery training in India holds potential for growth</h2>
            <p>As surgery advances with new technologies, like robotic surgery, ongoing education is vital for surgeons to adapt. Robotic surgery, more advanced than traditional laparoscopic methods, is now common in fields like gastrointestinal surgery, oncology, urology, and gynecology. Dr. Rajinder Parshad from AIIMS, New Delhi, mentions the increasing use of robotics in general surgery. AIIMS has launched a surgical robotics training center to enhance knowledge and skills in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) and train surgeons to perform procedures effectively using robotics.</p>
            <h3>Courses on offer</h3>
            <p>Formal robotic surgery training is relatively new in India, with potential for growth. Government hospitals mainly offer courses for resident doctors, including specialties like MCh in Minimal Access Surgery covering both laparoscopic and robotic techniques.</p>
            <p>AIIMS New Delhi and Rishikesh provide the MCh Minimal Access Surgery program, which includes training in robotic and laparoscopic surgery. The National Board of Examinations offers a three-year FNB MAS course focused on both techniques. Intuitive India collaborates with AIIMS for the Intuitive Robotic Onboard Program to train future surgeons in robotic-assisted surgery. Privately funded centers, often under the Vattikuti Foundation, also contribute to training and accessibility in robotic surgery.</p>
            <h3>Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>The adoption of robotic surgery by both young and experienced surgeons is leading to a significant increase in training institutes and the installation of robotic systems. In the past, due to limited training opportunities and mentors, many surgeons had to train abroad. However, this trend is changing. With the introduction of new training options like fellowships, MCh positions, and workshops, Indian surgeons now have the chance to train locally, reducing travel expenses and overcoming cultural and language barriers.</p>
            <p>The quality of technology and guidance available in India matches that of developed nations. Dr. Somashekhar highlights that India's dense population allows for hands-on training, which sets it apart from countries that mainly offer observational training programs.</p>
            <h3>Job Roles</h3>
            <p>Following extensive training in robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), a proficient surgeon becomes capable of independently conducting surgeries using robotic platforms. Given the collaborative nature of surgical procedures, the surgeon might either assist or lead surgeries based on their level of expertise. Typically, after completing the training, students are positioned as associate consultants, according to Dr. Somashekhar.</p>
