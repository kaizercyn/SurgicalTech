    <h1>When weâ€™ll be able to 3D-print organs and who will be able to afford them</h1>
    <p>Imagine a world where doctors can simply 3D-print a patient's kidney instead of the complex process of finding a donor match and hoping the transplant is successful. Well, that future might be just a decade away, thanks to 3D organ bioprinting, as explained by Jennifer Lewis, a professor at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. This cutting-edge technology involves using 3D printing to build artificial organs layer by layer, mimicking natural organs. What's driving this innovation? A very real and urgent need for organs.</p>
    <p>In the United States alone, as of March 8, 2023, there are more than 106,800 individuals anxiously waiting for organ transplants, while the supply falls far short of demand. This shortage stems from the challenges of finding suitable donor matches and ensuring the quality of available organs. While living donors can help, it's not without risks, and it often means taking an organ from one person who may need it to give it to another. However, there's hope on the horizon, with pioneers like Dr. Anthony Atala and his team achieving incredible breakthroughs in regenerative medicine, such as creating human bladders in a lab and successfully implanting them in patients, saving lives and pointing toward a promising future for organ replacement.</p>

    <h1>What Are Artificial Organs?</h1>
    <p>Scientists are working hard to craft artificial organs that can seamlessly become a part of the human body. These synthetic organs serve various purposes, from replacing and replicating natural organs to enhancing their functions. They offer a potential solution to the shortage of organ donors and also serve as valuable tools for medical training.</p>
    <p>These artificial organs fall into three main categories depending on the materials used in their creation. Mechanical artificial organs are constructed entirely from non-living materials like plastics and metals. Biomechanical organs blend living components, such as cells, with non-living materials. Lastly, biological or bioartificial organs are crafted using living cells in combination with biodegradable polymers. It's an exciting field of science with the potential to improve healthcare and medical training.</p>

    <h1>The future of 3D bioprinting</h1>
    <p>Believe it or not, there's some incredible stuff happening in the world of medical 3D printing. Scientists are making skin, bones, blood vessels, and even tiny organs using this technology. While we're not quite at the point of using these bioprinted parts in humans, the speed of progress is mind-blowing. A major milestone was when they successfully implanted a 3D-printed ear made from real cells into a person.</p>
    <p>In Poland, they've bioprinted a pancreas that worked in pigs for two weeks. And the United Therapeutics Corporation is getting closer to creating human lungs with 3D-printed scaffolds featuring thousands of kilometers of capillaries and millions of tiny air sacs for oxygen exchange, which is a big deal for future organ transplants. There's also a nifty mobile skin bioprinting system in the works that could heal tough wounds like burns right at a patient's bedside. Plus, they're making 3D-printed muscle that can actually contract and restore lost function. And if that's not enough, they've even created a "rabbit-sized" 3D-printed heart that beats like the real deal. So, while there are still challenges ahead, the future of medical technology looks pretty exciting!</p>

    <h1>How Are Artificial Organs Grown or Manufactured?</h1>
    <p>Making organs involves several crucial steps: planning, getting materials ready, adding cells, and letting the tissue mature. Scaffolds, like templates, play a big role, and we create them using methods like 3D printing and decellularization.</p>
    <p>Imagine 3D printing mimicking the body's matrix, then putting different cell types, even stem cells, onto it. Or using 3D bioprinting with a special ink made of living cells, polymers, and growth factors to build these structures. This tech has the potential to solve organ shortages and offer personalized organ solutions.</p>
    <p>In 3D bioprinting, scientists take specific cells, turn them into a printable ink, and layer by layer, build up the tissue. It's exciting stuff, leading to cool achievements like 3D-printed ears and complex heart components with living heart cells.</p>
    <p>Although there's more to explore, the future sure looks bright for this organ-making technology.</p>

    <h1>Advantages of 3D printing</h1>
    <p>Researchers at Wake Forest have been growing organs and tissues in the lab for years, using 3D printing to create mini-kidneys and mini-livers. The challenge now is making larger, fully functional organs, which they haven't quite achieved at organ scale.</p>
    <p>They've successfully 3D printed flat structures like skin, tubular structures like blood vessels, and hollow non-tubular organs like bladders. But bigger solid organs are tricky due to issues like vascularity, nutrition, and cell quality.</p>
    <p>Quality is a concern; for instance, heart cells from stem cells don't beat as strongly as natural ones. Producing enough cells for an organ is resource-intensive, and integrating these tissues into the body with blood vessels, nerves, and different cell types is complex. Still, progress is visible, like 3D-printed heart cells on a chip for drug testing.</p>
    <p>In the short term, 3D printing offers scale, precision, lower costs, reproducibility, and reduced organ rejection risk. While full-sized 3D-printed organ transplants are likely 20 to 30 years away, many remain optimistic that printed organs could become a reality within two decades. It's not science fiction; it's science in action.</p>

    <h1>Examples of Artificial Organs and How They Work</h1>
    <h2>Artificial sensory organs</h2>
    <p>Researchers have long sought ways to treat sensory dysfunctions and nervous system injuries. Traditional methods like nerve transplantation have limitations because they rely on slow nerve regeneration for recovery.</p>
    <p>Artificial sensory organs offer a faster solution by directly transmitting information to the brain. These devices come in various types, from helping with vision and hearing to taste and touch, all by stimulating nerves. Recent advances include things like artificial retinas and cochlear implants, while scientists are also working on innovative artificial nerves that can compensate for spinal cord damage by connecting with the brain and muscles.</p>
    <h2>Artificial kidney and artificial liver</h2>
    <p>There are many attempts to develop artificial systems for treating kidney and liver diseases, but they come with their challenges. Traditional methods like dialysis machines and bioartificial supports can limit patients' activities, require strict adherence to diets and medications, and can be costly.</p>
    <p>One approach involves renal assistance devices (RADs), which try to mimic kidney functions using a combination of filters and bioreactors. Researchers are working on making these devices smaller and implantable. They're also exploring various materials like pig kidneys, discarded human kidneys, or synthetic polymers to create scaffolds for bioartificial kidneys.</p>
    <p>Similarly, artificial livers could help with organ shortages in treating liver failure. Scientists have even created something called "liver-buds" using stem cells to rescue animals with liver failure. It's all about finding innovative ways to tackle these health challenges.</p>
    <h2>Artificial heart</h2>
    <p>Scientists and doctors use 3D printing to plan heart surgeries and make custom-fit implants. They've come up with clever ways to boost implant success, like using special materials to create cardiac-specific structures. In experiments, they've even crafted intricate heart components, such as branched coronary arteries and embryonic hearts, using hydrogels and data from CT and MRI scans. It's like creating detailed 3D models of the heart to help improve surgical procedures.</p>

    <h1>Real life event</h1>
    <p>Last year in San Antonio, Texas, Dr. Arturo Bonilla performed a groundbreaking procedure: he implanted a 3D-bioprinted ear made from the patient's own cartilage cells. While Dr. Bonilla is a seasoned pediatric microtia surgeon, this case was unique, marking the convergence of science fiction with reality.</p>
    <p>3D bioprinting is making significant strides in the field of medical research and practice. Although the progress is gradual, it's undeniably real. According to Professor Tal Dvir, a leading expert in tissue engineering, he envisions a future where we can 3D-print organs for transplantation within a decade, starting with simpler tissues like skin and cartilage and eventually progressing to complex organs like the heart, liver, and kidney.</p>
