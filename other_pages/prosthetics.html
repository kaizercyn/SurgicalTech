        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The loss of any limb is a traumatic event that can dramatically hinder an amputee’s ability to live a healthy, productive, and independent life. In 2017, 57.7 million people were living with limb amputation due to traumatic causes worldwide. Leading traumatic causes of limb amputation were falls (36.2%), road injuries (15.7%), other transportation injuries (11.2%), and mechanical forces (10.4%). Limb loss affects every country worldwide, but the causes vary dramatically. In today’s modern and innovative times, breakthroughs in the technology of prosthetics have made remarkable strides. </p>

        <p>In the realm of prosthetics, cutting-edge technologies are ushering in a new era of functionality and sensory experience that was once unimaginable. With the potential to restore both tactile sensations and precise control, recent breakthroughs hold the promise of transforming the lives of amputees. Scientists have identified two groundbreaking approaches to achieve this feat.</p>

        <p>One remarkable avenue of innovation involves integrating heat-sensitive technology into bionic skin. This biocompatible interface can be seamlessly draped over a prosthetic limb, offering an unprecedented level of interaction with the surrounding environment. A global team of scientists has successfully developed an artificial skin equipped with advanced heat sensors capable of detecting temperature changes. This innovation mirrors the thermosensitive abilities of human skin, allowing amputees to experience the sensation of warmth through their prosthetic limbs. This breakthrough not only redefines the sense of touch for prosthetic users but also underscores the potential for future advancements in sensory feedback.</p>
