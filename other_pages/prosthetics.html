        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The loss of any limb is a traumatic event that can dramatically hinder an amputee’s ability to live a healthy, productive, and independent life. In 2017, 57.7 million people were living with limb amputation due to traumatic causes worldwide. Leading traumatic causes of limb amputation were falls (36.2%), road injuries (15.7%), other transportation injuries (11.2%), and mechanical forces (10.4%). Limb loss affects every country worldwide, but the causes vary dramatically. In today’s modern and innovative times, breakthroughs in the technology of prosthetics have made remarkable strides. </p>

    <h1>Notable breakthroughs</h1>
    <div id="afac">
        <h1>Allowing feeling and control</h1>
        <p>In the realm of prosthetics, cutting-edge technologies are ushering in a new era of functionality and sensory experience that was once unimaginable. With the potential to restore both tactile sensations and precise control, recent breakthroughs hold the promise of transforming the lives of amputees. Scientists have identified two groundbreaking approaches to achieve this feat.</p>
        <img src="/other_resources/integheat.jpg">
        <p>One remarkable avenue of innovation involves integrating heat-sensitive technology into bionic skin. This biocompatible interface can be seamlessly draped over a prosthetic limb, offering an unprecedented level of interaction with the surrounding environment. A global team of scientists has successfully developed an artificial skin equipped with advanced heat sensors capable of detecting temperature changes. This innovation mirrors the thermosensitive abilities of human skin, allowing amputees to experience the sensation of warmth through their prosthetic limbs. This breakthrough not only redefines the sense of touch for prosthetic users but also underscores the potential for future advancements in sensory feedback.</p>

        <p>In another leap forward, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab have introduced an ingenious strategy to enhance the control of prosthetic limbs. The conventional electromyography approach, which records muscle electrical activity, offers limited control over prosthetic movement. MIT's Media Lab researchers have devised an alternative method that involves the insertion of minuscule magnetic beads into the residual muscle tissue of amputees. This innovation enables the precise measurement of muscle length during contraction, providing instantaneous feedback. This data is then communicated to a bionic prosthesis in mere milliseconds, enabling a level of control that was once considered unattainable.</p>
        <p>The future of prosthetics is taking a remarkable turn as science and technology collaborate to recreate the essential elements of touch and control. From sophisticated heat-sensitive artificial skin to muscle-tracking magnetic bead systems, these advancements hold the potential to not only enhance the physical capabilities of prosthetic limbs but also to restore a fundamental sense of connection with the world. As these innovations continue to evolve, they promise to revolutionize the field of prosthetics, offering newfound hope and possibilities for amputees worldwide.</p>

        <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p>Undoubtedly, there’s promise for amputees with advances in robotics, machine learning, and prosthetics. Given how A.I.-powered prostheses, with their abilities to be upgraded both on the hardware and software fronts, hold the potential to be superior to biological arms. György Lévay, Research Manager at Infinite Biomedical Technologies, notes that the integration of artificial intelligence into prosthetics signifies a monumental leap forward in the realm of assistive technologies. The intersection of robotics and machine learning opens doors to prosthetic limbs that not only emulate natural movement but can adapt, learn, and even self-improve over time. Such a convergence of technology allows for prosthetics that transcend the limitations of biological limbs.</p>
        <p>Advancements in artificial intelligence are reshaping the landscape of prosthetic development. A.I.-powered prostheses possess the remarkable ability to evolve continuously, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable with traditional prosthetics. The inherent adaptability of these devices allows for personalized and real-time adjustments, addressing the changing needs and preferences of individual users.</p>
        <p>Lévay's insights underline the potential for A.I.-driven prosthetics to surpass the capabilities of natural limbs. By integrating cutting-edge technology, these prostheses can offer enhanced precision, responsiveness, and intuitive movement. Machine learning algorithms enable prosthetics to learn from users' interactions, leading to refined motor control and a more seamless integration into daily life.</p>
        <p>The synergy between artificial intelligence and prosthetics is propelling the field into an era of unprecedented innovation. As A.I. continues to advance, so too will the capabilities of prosthetic limbs, ultimately creating a future where individuals with limb loss can not only regain lost functionalities but also access enhanced abilities that were previously inconceivable.</p>
