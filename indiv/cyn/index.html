    <h1>What is Blockchain?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>A distributed secure database or ledger shared among a network’s nodes, where up-to-date information is available to all participants at the same time. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses. It can be used to make data in any industry immutable.

    <h1>How Does a Blockchain Work?</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You might be familiar with spreadsheets or databases. A blockchain is somewhat similar because it is a database where information is entered and stored. However, the critical difference between a traditional database or spreadsheet and a blockchain is how the data is structured and accessed.</p>
    <p>A blockchain consists of programs called scripts that conduct the tasks you usually would in a database: Entering and accessing information and saving and storing it somewhere. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.</p>
    <p>The blockchain collects transaction information and enters it into a block, like a cell in a spreadsheet containing information. Once complete, the information is run through an encryption algorithm, which creates a hexadecimal number called the hash.</p>
    <p>The hash is then entered into the following block header and encrypted with the other information in the block. This creates a series of blocks that are chained together.</p>

    <h1>Benefits of Blockchains</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Accuracy of the Chain</h2>
    <p>Transactions on the blockchain network are approved by thousands of computers and devices. This removes almost all people from the verification process, resulting in less human error and an accurate record of information. Even if a computer on the network were to make a computational mistake, the error would only be made to one copy of the blockchain and not be accepted by the rest of the network.</p>
    <h2>Cost Reductions</h2>
    <p>Typically, consumers pay a bank to verify a transaction or a notary to sign a document. Blockchain eliminates the need for third-party verification—and, with it, their associated costs. For example, business owners incur a small fee when they accept credit card payments because banks and payment-processing companies have to process those transactions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have a central authority and has limited transaction fees.</p>
    <h2>Decentralization</h2>
    <p>Blockchain does not store any of its information in a central location. Instead, the blockchain is copied and spread across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is added to the blockchain, every computer on the network updates its blockchain to reflect the change.</p>
    <p>By spreading that information across a network, rather than storing it in one central database, blockchain becomes more difficult to tamper with.</p>
    <h2>Efficient Transactions</h2>
    <p>Transactions placed through a central authority can take up to a few days to settle. If you attempt to deposit a check on Friday evening, for example, you may not actually see funds in your account until Monday morning. Financial institutions operate during business hours, usually five days a week—but a blockchain works 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year.</p>
    <p>On some blockchains, transactions can be completed in minutes and considered secure after just a few. This is particularly useful for cross-border trades, which usually take much longer because of time zone issues and the fact that all parties must confirm payment processing.</p>
    <h2>Private Transactions</h2>
    <p>Many blockchain networks operate as public databases, meaning anyone with an internet connection can view a list of the network’s transaction history. Although users can access transaction details, they cannot access identifying information about the users making those transactions. It is a common misperception that blockchain networks like Bitcoin are fully anonymous; they are actually pseudonymous because there is a viewable address that can be associated with a user if the information gets out.</p>
    <h2>Secure Transactions</h2>
    <p>Once a transaction is recorded, its authenticity must be verified by the blockchain network. After the transaction is validated, it is added to the blockchain block. Each block on the blockchain contains its unique hash and the unique hash of the block before it. Therefore, the blocks cannot be altered once the network confirms them.</p>
    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>Most blockchains are entirely open-source software. This means that everyone can view its code. This gives auditors the ability to review cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin for security. However, it also means there is no absolute authority on who controls Bitcoin’s code or how it is edited. Because of this, anyone can suggest changes or upgrades to the system. If a majority of the network users agree that the new version of the code with the upgrade is sound and worthwhile, then Bitcoin can be updated.</p>
    <h2>Banking the Unbanked</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most profound facet of blockchain and cryptocurrency is the ability for anyone, regardless of ethnicity, gender, location, or cultural background, to use it. According to The World Bank, an estimated 1.3 billion adults do not have bank accounts or any means of storing their money or wealth. Moreover, nearly all of these individuals live in developing countries where the economy is in its infancy and entirely dependent on cash.</p>
    <p>These people are often paid in physical cash. They then need to store this physical cash in hidden locations in their homes or other places, incentivizing robbers or violence. While not impossible to steal, crypto makes it more difficult for would-be thieves.</p>
    <p>Blockchains of the future are also looking for solutions to not only be a unit of account for wealth storage but also to store medical records, property rights, and a variety of other legal contracts.</p>
